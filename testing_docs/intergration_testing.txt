>Integration Testing

Integration testing involves testing the interactions between different components or systems to ensure they work together as intended. It focuses on the integration points between units of code.

>Purpose:

Verify that different parts of the system work together as expected.
Identify issues that occur when units are combined.
Ensure that the overall system meets its functional requirements.

>Characteristics:

Combination: Tests multiple units or components together.
Complexity: Can be more complex and time-consuming than unit tests.
Environment: Often requires a more complete setup, sometimes including databases, external services, or other subsystems.
Scenarios: Tests are based on use cases that reflect real-world usage.
